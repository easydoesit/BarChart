# Scalable BarCharts

## About

This project allows you to create simple, stacked bar charts in a horizontal or vertical orientation.

You can choose the width and height of the entire chart. Those dimensions will include the chart axis, labels and the complete graph.

The graph scales to the size of the chart, so bars represent the actual numbers.

### Options for the User are:

- Height Size
- Width Size
- Space between bars
- Label placement
- Label Colors
- Title Font and Colors
- Single or Stacked Bars
- Data aligns Horizontally or Vertically
